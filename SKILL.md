## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Not authorized to send Apple events" | Grant Automation permission to terminal |
| No tracks found | Ensure your library is synced / not empty |
| AirPlay device not listed | Check device is on the same network and available |
| Player state returns "stopped" unexpectedly | Open Music.app manually first, then retry |
| Commands hang or timeout | Music.app may be unresponsive; restart it |

## Technical Notes

- All commands use AppleScript via `osascript` (no private APIs).
- Music.app is the successor to iTunes on macOS Catalina and later.
- Apple Music subscription is not required for local library playback.
- AppleScript `tell application "Music"` launches the app if it is not running.
